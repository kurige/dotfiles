Note that todo.txt is currently configured to sync notes automatically using Dropbox.

If you have Dropbox on a custom path, then you will need to make sure you edit todo.cfg.symlink to match the location of the Dropbox folder.

Also, on windows, you will need to symlink the dropbox folder to `$HOME/Dropbox` like so: `ln -s /cygdrive/c/Users/Chris/Dropbox`.
